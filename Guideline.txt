1.Estimation:
	Estimation is always done with fit method.It generally takes one argument as dataset in supervised learning case it will take two arguments 1.dataset and 2.labels(other parameters are hyperparameter)
2.Transformers:
	transform().parameters 1.dataset
	fit_transform() is equivalent to calling fit() and then transform()
3.predictors
	prdict()-predicts the value
	score()-gives how accurate the results are

estimators hyperparameters are accesible by imputer.strategy(public instance variables)
estimators learned parameters are accesible with an underscoe suffix imputer.statistics_		

One-hot encoding:
	We will create bits for every labels and give them 1 if it occurs
	suppose abcdefg amd label is c
	then 	0010000 will be its one hot encoder output.
